 no i was just a little confused because i m running procmail on a gateway and sits between the external sendmail box and internal exchange bridgehead server so there isn t any delivery to the local system the only email it gets is inbound at the moment and we re looking to get rid of complication and go back to two boxes i did a test which looked like you guys are right about procmail but testing is very limited due to the config i currently have it s just confusing when set up as a gateway jason original message from stephane lentz mailto stephane lentz ansf alcatel fr sent monday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm to spamassassin talk URL subject re satalk separate inbound and outbound on mon sep NUMBER NUMBER at NUMBER NUMBER NUMBERpm NUMBER jason qualkenbush wrote is there is way to separate inbound and outbound email so that i only check for spam on inbound mail and ignore the outbound i m using sendmail and running procmail on the gateway to call spamassassin i know it more of a sendmail question but my google searches have only turned up people trying to log all inbound and outbound email using procmail spamassassin doesn t get called for outgoing email messages sent to other machines procmail local delivery agent inbound traffic to local machine sl stephane lentz alcanet international internet services this URL email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL this URL email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL ,0
this is just an semi educated guess if i m wrong someone please correct me spamd setuid s to the user running spamc since you re calling spamc from a global procmailrc file it s being run as root most likely if called as root spamd won t open user_prefs files from the spamc man page u username this argument has been semi obsoleted to have spamd use per user config files run spamc as the user whose config files spamd should load if you re running spamc as some other user though eg root mail nobody cyrus etc then you can still use this flag the solution is to set dropprivs yes in etc procmailrc just before running spamc from the procmailrc man page dropprivs if set to yes procmail will drop all privileges it might have had suid or sgid this is only useful if you want to guarantee that the bottom half of the etc procmailrc file is executed on behalf of the recipient i hope that helps and i also hope it s right st original message from spamassassin talk admin URL mailto spamassassin talk admin URL on behalf of cheryl l southard sent tuesday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm to spamassassin talk URL subject satalk user_prefs ignored hi all i am running spamassassin NUMBER NUMBER with procmail as my local delivery agent with sendmail i use spamc spamd so that it runs site wide from etc procmailrc spamd is run as root with the flags d a c and spamc isn t run with any flags when i was testing the program i deployed spamc from my personal procmailrc file my spamassassin user_prefs file was read each time i can see this because i have a non default required_hits value which gets reported in every e mail on the x spam status line now that i run spamc from the global etc procmailrc file my spamassassin user_prefs file is no longer being read or processed from e mails from outside computers the required_hits value gets set back to the one in etc mail spamassassin local cf however if i send local e mail my user_prefs file is read and processed correctly does anyone know how to fix this problem if this is a spamassassin or procmail bug thanks cheryl cheryl southard cld URL this URL email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL this URL email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL ,0

 spamtalk said probably better than the spam phrases approach would be the database approach as currently used for white black listing any way to tie that to an xml retrieval from a list of central repositories does mysql do replication a properly done xml would let us eyeball the list as well as use it to keep the database up to date another idea could we synthesize an rbl so that URL becomes URL for a reverse lookup it is going to get tricky how to specify a randomized intermediate directory a good plan needs an implementation though URL hmm seems down to me basically it s a plan to store hash sums of urls phone numbers found in spam in a dnsbl for apps like spamassassin to look up a little like spamcop s spamvertized url list j this URL email is sponsored by dedicated servers only NUMBER linux or freebsd free setup fast network get your own server today at URL _______________________________________________ spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk URL URL ,0

gary funck gary intrepid com NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER in my experience there are spam messages that sneak past spam assassin that razor will pick up those are the ones that i m calling marginal basically i m hoping that the collective of razor users make a better judge of spam than any single program like sa can and therefore i can benefit from their judgement and get more extensive spam filtering i ve seen examples of this already where sa doesn t score the spam high enough to bounce it but razor does i think perhaps you missed the fact that sa scores are adjustable if you want sa to tag all messages listed in razor then you can put this in your spamassassin user_prefs file score razor_check NUMBER the default score is NUMBER and the default threshold needed is NUMBER therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by sa then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above NUMBER would be sufficient if you are already using sa then the above would be more efficient otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice once for sa and once again afterward if you really want to run razor individually then you should set the score razor_check NUMBER so that sa won t do it and avoid the double network hit however one of the benefits of using sa in combination with razor has been the history of false positive reports in the razor database the current score of NUMBER is hefty but not enough by itself to tag as spam but for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold razorNUMBER addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide of use as razorNUMBER bob ,0

i did something crudely along those lines for vms vax maybe NUMBER years ago there is at least one product that does it for pc though i don t recall its name it is also handy for cases where you have a cd image of some filesystem or some other image of a filesystem that is intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept or is not graceful readonly storage it is also more or less necessary if you want to work with worm file structures which are older still there have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the early NUMBERs if not before a generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement snapshots on top of an existing filesystem the written information must obviously be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you wrote to the storage a device level implementation is however perfectly adequate it does not of course distinguish for you what should have been changed and what should not if you truly know a device or perhaps a partition must not be written it can be simpler to either return error on writes or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data ntfs lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments i have not tried it on extfNUMBER or reiser btw think about your mention of raid and consider the complexity of writing to raidNUMBER or raidNUMBER i would contend that with cheaper storage these days it makes little sense to use raid save for shadowing and possibly striping those at least do not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher raid levels have and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk may hold NUMBER gigs and up why not dedicate another whole disk to fault recovery and lose the complexity and slow write sometimes of raid glenn everhart original message from bmord URL mailto bmord URL sent tuesday september NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER pm to webappsec securityfocus com secprog securityfocus subject use of base image delta image for automated recovery from attacks hi i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine vm instances that base image is never altered by a vm instance instead each vm instance writes changes to its own redo log future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine this is described here thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list URL could this basic concept be used to easily make self fixing client server applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks even before those attacks have been discovered here is what i imagine the physical architectures of most production client server systems are layered for example your basic web application might have a web server running apache connected to an application server running some jNUMBERee or net business logic connected to a database server for persistence the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next other paritions may need to be writable for say swap space but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot when someone cracks this system they will probably change an image that shouldn t be changed e g they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server but what if the web server ran off a base image writing changes to a delta or redo partition and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal because it is only deleting data rather than restoring from backup in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible this base redo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid allowing for greater performance reliability and hack resistance this concept could also be applied to the application servers and even the database server partitions except for those partitions which contain the table data files of course does anyone do this already or is this a new concept or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i don t yet know i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems it would allow for the hardware separation of volatile and non volatile disk images it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations only it

the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the universe too big to decrypt my point is there will never be a safe key what i would consider is how long does the data need to be protected if you need to protect the data for longer than NUMBER months do not release it to the public if you are trying to stop the general public your customer from coping the data then use what is available on the market if you want to stop the bootleggers do not release the data to the public i have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked the act of unlocking the key gives away it s secret the tougher the lock the more pissed off your customers will be take ms xp for example only the home user is forced to register think of the nightmare if business had to register every copy how many times have we needed to reinstall our laptop os notice the amount of mac s sold after the xp release these where mostly home users that converted to mac os the new audio cd s that have digital copy protection so not play on my computer does this stop me from copying the cd no however it does make me return them and get my money back the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked jef ,0

hi everybody i m writing a web application in java tomcat jsp servlets database access with postgresql this will be released under the gpl and will eventually be useful as a framework for other web applications the application main focus is e commerce but not limited to that i would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database but i have some problem figuring out the right approach above all how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server a problem that i was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryption decryption the api that i m using is the jca jdkNUMBER NUMBER x and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always i can serialize the object and store in the database but this is not the most secure approach this key is needed to decrypt data in the database but the database is accessible from the web application assuming that i can find a good and secure place where to store the database password i can use a different database with different user argh to complex and doesn t really solve the problem where i can found good documentation about this topic there is another approach that i would share with the list something i thought that can be of bit interest but probabily wrong and insecure after all i m a real beginner in secure programming and i m here to learn methods and technics first of all i need a secure way to keep database passwords secure so i have to keep them separate from the main server the right approach could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user not tomcat so it is not shared with other web services or worst the nobody user that has no shell login but has a default home directory or a place where it can hold passwords and keys the web application could then open an ssl connection could be done in the init method at server startup to get database passwords the small bean could check via code signature rmi whatever else that the source is the right one and handle all the database connections or give the db connection password to the main web application in this way we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in shared directories and also an attacker should get root bean user account to read data this is not perfect and works only if your provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java application that means really another server running in the background any suggestions thank you mario torre please avoid sending me word or powerpoint attachments see URL ,0

 dunno about the other tools but spamassassin is a breeze spamassassin also adds other headers as well which give you more detail guido do you feel capable of writing such a tool it doesn t look too guido hard sure but at the moment i have to stop reading email for a few hours and do some real work i ll see if i can modify URL suitably over the weekend skip ,0
guido van rossum wrote i personally don t think imap has a bright future but for people who do use it that s certainly a good approach writing an imap server is a non trivial task the specification is huge and clients do all kinds of weird stuff pop is very easy in comparison perhaps you could forward messages to a special address or save them in a special folder to mark them as false negatives alternatively perhaps there could be a separate protocol and client that could be used to review additions to the training set each day a few random spam and ham messages could be grabbed as candidates someone would periodically startup the client review the candidates reclassify or remove any messages they don t like and add them to the training set neil ,0
 ns neil schemenauer nas python ca writes ns writing an imap server is a non trivial task that s what i ve been told by everyone i ve talked to who s actually tried to write one ns alternatively perhaps there could be a separate protocol and ns client that could be used to review additions to the training ns set each day a few random spam and ham messages could be ns grabbed as candidates someone would periodically startup the ns client review the candidates reclassify or remove any ns messages they don t like and add them to the training set i think people will be much more motivated to report spam than ham i like the general approach that copies of random messages will be sequestered for some period of time before they re assumed to be ham matched with a simple spam reporting scheme this could keep the training up to date with little effort i ve sketched out an approach a listserver like mailman could do along these lines and if i get some free time i ll hack something together i like the idea of a pop proxy which is classifying messages as they re pulled from the server the easiest way for such a beast to be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special folder or file that the pop proxy would periodically consult barry ,0
on fri NUMBER sep NUMBER guido van rossum wrote quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm i d like to think about deployment eventually individuals and postmasters should be able to download a spambayes software distribution answer a few configuration questions about their mail setup training and false positives and install it as a filter a more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can easily be used by individuals since we re more likely to find individuals willing to risk this than postmasters my impression is that a pre collected corpus would not fit most individuals very well but each individual or group should collect their own corpus one problem that comes upp immediately individuals are lazy if i currently get NUMBER spam and NUMBER ham a day and i ll have to press the delete button once for each spam i ll be happy to press the spam button instead however if in addition have to press a ham button for each ham it starts to look much less like a win to me add the time to install and setup the whole machinery and i ll just keep hitting delete the suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete action that adds a message to the ham corpus i see two problems with this the ham will be a bit skewed mail that i keep around without deleting will not be counted secondly if i by force of habit happen to press the delete key instead of the spam key i ll end up with spam in the ham anyways i would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham the obvious thing to do is to trigger on the spam button and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one in the ham corpus and simply remove them to do this we need a way to compare two word count histograms to see how similar they are any ideas also i personally would prefer to not see the spam at all if they get bounced preferably already in the smtp false positives become the senders problem to rewrite to remove the spam smell in a well tuned system then there spam corpus will be much smaller than the ham corpus so it would be possible to be slightly over agressive when clearing potential spam from the ham corpus this should make it easier to keep it clean having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus there s less need to worry about it getting there by mistake and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus that didn t get deleted by the spam filtering it might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from the spam corpus in case of user ooops paul ,0
 i guess mua level filtering is just a fallback for people who don t have NUMBER a burning all consuming hatred of junk mail NUMBER root access to all mail servers they rely on and NUMBER the ability and inclination to install an mta with every bell and whistle tweaked to keep out junk mail sure but for most people changing their company s or isp s server requires years of lobbying while they have total and immediate control over their own mua that said i agree that we should offer a good solution to postmasters and i trust that your ideas are right on the mark guido van rossum home page URL ,0

so then guido van rossum guido python org is all like basic procmail usage goes something like this NUMBERfw spamassassin p NUMBER x spam status yes spam do you feel capable of writing such a tool it doesn t look too hard not to beat a dead horse but that s exactly what my spamcan package did for those just tuning in spamcan is a thingy i wrote before i knew about tim co s work on this crazy stuff you can download it from URL but i m not going to work on it anymore i m currently writing a new one based on classifier and timtest s booty kicking tokenizer i ll probably have something soon like maybe half an hour and no it s not too hard the hard part is storing the data somewhere i don t want to use zodb as i d like something a person can just drop in with a default python install so anydbm is looking like my best option i already have a setup like this using xavier leroy s spamoracle which does the same sort of thing you call it from procmail it adds a new header and then you can filter on that header really easy here s how i envision this working everybody gets four new mailboxes train eggs train spam trained eggs trained spam you copy all your spam and eggs into the train boxes as you get it how frequently you do this would be up to you but you d get better results if you did it more often and you d be wise to always copy over anything which was misclassified then every night the spam fairy swoops down and reads through your folders learning about what sorts of things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam after she s done she moves your mail into the trained folders this would work for anybody using imap on a unix box or folks who read their mail right off the server i ve spoken with some fellows at work about exchange and they seem to beleive that exchange exports appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail client to bind the key s to move to train spam and h to move to train eggs eventually if enough people used this sort of thing it d start showing up in mail clients that s the delete as spam button paul graham was talking about the hormel company might not think well of using the word ham as the opposite of spam and they ve been amazingly cool about the use of their product name for things thus far so i propose we start calling non spam something more innocuous and more monty pythonic such as eggs neale ,0
 jeremy hylton i think one step towards deployment is creating a re usable tokenizer for mail messages the current codebase doesn t expose an easy to use or easy to customize tokenizer tokenize couldn t be easier to use it takes a string argument and produces a stream of tokens whether via explicit list or generator or tuple or doesn t matter all the tokenize functions in URL and URL are freely interchangeable this way note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would do any good or if it would in which ways customization could be helpful that s a research issue on which no work has been done the timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical knowledge about how to parse mail messages but the module wasn t designed for re use that s partly a failure of imagination wink splitting out all knowledge of tokenization is just a large block cut and paste there it s done change the from timtoken import tokenize at the top to use any other tokenizer now if you want to make it easier still feel free to check in something better i d like to see a module that can take a single message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one the msg and msgstream classes in URL are a start at that but it s hard to do anything truly useful here when people use all sorts of different physical representations for email msgs mboxes in various formats one file per folder one file per msg skip s gzipped gimmick if you re a python coder wink you should find it very easy to change the guts of msg and msgstream to handle your peculiar scheme defining interfaces for these guys should be done i d like to see the tokenize by customizable too tim had to exclude some headers from his test data because there were particular biases in the test data if other people have test data without those biases they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include them or exclude others this sounds like a bottomless pit to me and there s no easier way to customize than to edit the code as readme txt still says though massive refactoring would help hop to it ,0
i think that when considering deployment a solution that supports all python platforms and not just the l unix crowd is desirable mac and pc users are more apt to be using a commercial mua that s unlikely to offer hooking ability at least not easily as mentioned elsewhere even l unix users may find an mua solution easier to use then getting it added to their mta sysops make programmers look like flaming liberals my notion of a solution for windows outlook has been as guido described a client server client side does popNUMBER imap mapi fetching of which i m only going to implement popNUMBER initially potentially on several hosts spamhams the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message qmail style the mua accesses this ethunk as a server to obtain all the ham spam is retained in the ethunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection and training of spam filter and the ham will go forward after being used for training on the next mua fetch ethunk would sit on a timer for always online users but i am not clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme outbound mail would use a direct path from the mua to the mta hopefully all muas can split the host fetch send url s imo end users are likely to be more intested in n way classification if this is available the simple viewer could be enhanced to support viewing via folders and at least for me the outlook nightmare is over i would use this as my only mua n b according to my recent readings the best n way classifier uses something called a support vector machine svm which is NUMBER NUMBER more accurate then naive bayes nb i wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code that way it could be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user s situation david leblanc seattle wa usa ,0

 note that header names are case insensitive so this one s no different than mime version similarly other headers in your list ignoring case here may or may not help that s for experiment to decide it s plausible that case is significant if e g a particular spam mailing package generates unusual case or a particular clueless spammer misconfigures his package i found it made no difference for my testing the brilliance of anthony s just count them scheme is that it requires no thought so can t be fooled wink header lines that are evenly distributed across spam and ham will turn out to be worthless indicators prob near NUMBER NUMBER so do no harm zactly i started off doing clever clever things and as always with this stuff found that stupid with a rock beats smart with scissors every time anthony baxter anthony interlink com au it s never too late to have a happy childhood ,0
 looks like your ham corpus by and large has to jeremy URL in a header while your spam corpus by and large doesn t but this one does interestingly for me one of the highest value spam indicators was the name of the mail host that the spam was delivered to in the to line so mail to info URL was pretty much a dead cert for the filters anthony baxter anthony interlink com au it s never too late to have a happy childhood ,0
 jeremy hylton wrote then i tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the words in the header and emitted like this s s hdr word that worked too well the received and date headers helped the classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is new heh i hit the same problem but the other way round when i first started playing with this i d collected spam for a week or two then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes course it instantly picked up on received NUMBER as a non ham curse that too smart for me software still it s probably a good thing to note in the documentation about the software when collecting spam ham make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source anthony anthony baxter anthony interlink com au it s never too late to have a happy childhood ,0
 course it instantly picked up on received NUMBER as a non ham spam sigh anthony baxter anthony interlink com au it s never too late to have a happy childhood ,0
there seem to be two drivers for the classifier now neale pickett s URL and the original URL according to the readme txt URL hasn t been kept up to date is there anything in there that isn t covered by URL about the only useful feature of URL that URL doesn t yet copy is u which calculates spamness for an entire mailbox this feature can easily be copied into URL URL also has a large collection of tokenizers but URL rules so i m not sure how interesting that is now therefore i propose to nuke URL after adding a u feature anyone against i imagine that skip or barry might have a stake in URL tim seems to have moved all code he s working to other modules guido van rossum home page URL ,0
 i actually like neale s x spam disposition header i just wonder if maybe we should choose something with a different prefix than x spam so that people don t confuse it with spamassassin all of whose headers begin with that prefix also some sort of version information would be useful perhaps the cvs version number for the classifier module could be tacked on skip ,0
 skip montanaro wrote i actually like neale s x spam disposition header i just wonder if maybe we should choose something with a different prefix than x spam so that people don t confuse it with spamassassin all of whose headers begin with that prefix i think it s fine in general just so long as no one checks in anything that puts it into my test corpus or alternately whatever is chosen should be ignored by the tokenizer i know my mail host interlink runs sa but i also run it with my own set of rules and scores i don t want my spam filter to be getting messed up by an upstream spam filter ,0

so then tim peters tim one comcast net is all like i m not sure what you re doing but suspect you re storing individual wordinfo pickles if so most of the administrative pickle bloat is due to that and doesn t happen if you pickle an entire classifier instance directly yeah that s exactly what i was doing i didn t realize i was incurring administrative pickle bloat this way i m specifically trying to make things faster and smaller so i m storing individual wordinfo pickles into an anydbm dict keyed by token the result is that it s almost NUMBER times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail NUMBERs vs NUMBER NUMBERs however it does say all over the place that the goal of this project isn t to make the fastest or the smallest implementation so i guess i ll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts to point more in that direction NUMBER seconds is probably fast enough for people to use it in their procmailrc which is what i was after if you re desparate to save memory write a subclass that s probably what i ll do if i get too antsy trying to think of ways to sneak administrative pickle boat into casual conversation neale ,0

 choose something with a different prefix than x spam so that people don t confuse it with spamassassin neale how about x spambayes disposition or x hammie disposition if neale there ll be other classifier front ends i kinda like hammie your front end was there first so i suspect it will rule the front end roost s ,0

before we get too far down this road what do people think of creating a spambayes package containing classifier and tokenizer this is just to minimize clutter in site packages skip ,0
 jeremy hylton here s clarification of why i did that s pretty much what i had guessed thanks one more to try first test results using tokenizer tokenizer tokenize_headers unmodified second test results using mboxtest mytokenizer tokenize_headers this uses all headers except received data and x from_ try the latter again but call the base tokenize_headers too ,0
 before we get too far down this road what do people think of creating a spambayes package containing classifier and tokenizer this is just to minimize clutter in site packages too early imo if you mean to leave the various other tools out of it if and when we package this perhaps we should use barry s trick from the email package for making the package itself the toplevel dir of the distribution rather than requiring an extra directory level just so the package can be a subdir of the distro guido van rossum home page URL ,0
 guido on the classifier pickle on sf i downloaded and played with it a bit but had no time to do anything systematic cool it correctly recognized a spam that slipped through sa ditto but it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any mime structure or html parts and several messages in my saved zope geeks list that happened to be using mime and or html do you know why the strangest implied claim there is that it hates mime independent of html for example the spamprob of content type text plain in that pickle is under NUMBER NUMBER content type multipart alternative gets NUMBER NUMBER but that s not a killer clue and one bit of good content will more than cancel it out wrt hating html possibilities include NUMBER it really had to do with something other than mime html NUMBER these are pure html not multipart alternative with a text plain part so that the tags aren t getting stripped the pickled classifier despises all hints of html due to its URL heritage NUMBER these are multipart alternative with a text plain part but the latter doesn t contain the same text as the text html part for example as anthony reported perhaps the text plain part just says something like this is an hmtl message if it s NUMBER it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize meaning even if it is pure html strip the tags anyway in fact i d like to do that and default it to true the extreme hatred of html on tech lists strikes me as umm extreme wink so i guess i ll have to retrain it yes you told me so that would be a different experiment i m certainly curious to see whether jeremy s much worse than mine error rates are typical or aberrant ,0
 but it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any mime structure or html parts and several messages in my saved zope geeks list that happened to be using mime and or html do you know

 i also looked in more detail at some f p s in my geeks traffic the first one s a doozie that s the term right it has lots of html clues that are apparently ignored the clues below are loaded with snippets unique to html like br i meant to say that they were NUMBER NUMBER clues cancelled out by NUMBER NUMBER clues but that s wrong too it looks i haven t grokked this part of your code yet this one has way more than NUMBER clues and it seems the classifier basically ended up counting way more NUMBER NUMBER than NUMBER NUMBER clues and no others made it into the list i thought it was looking for clues with values in between apparently it found none that weren t exactly NUMBER NUMBER that sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues this happened to be the longest one but there were quite a few similar ones i wonder if there s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the html it was heavily marked up html with ads in the sidebar but the body text was a serious discussion of oo and soft coding with lots of highly technical words as clues including zope and zeo that there are any NUMBER NUMBER clues in here means the scheme ran out of anything interesting to look at adding in more header lines should cure that are there any minable but unmined header lines in your corpus left or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make progress there the seventh was similar i scanned a bunch more until i got bored and most of them were either of the first form brief text with url followed by quoted html from website if those were text plain the html tags should have been stripped i m still confused about this part no sorry these were all of the following structure multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website i guess you get this when you click on mail this page in some browsers that html tags aren t getting stripped remains the biggest mystery to me still this seems confused jeremy didn t use my trained classifier pickle he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora that s an entirely different kind of experiment from the one you re trying indeed you re the only one so far to report results from trying my pickle on their own email and i never expected that to work well it s a much bigger mystery to me why jeremy got such relatively worse results from training his own and he s the only one so far to report results from that experiment i think it s still corpus size guido van rossum home page URL ,0
 guido i meant to say that they were NUMBER NUMBER clues cancelled out by NUMBER NUMBER clues but that s wrong too it looks i haven t grokked this part of your code yet this one has way more than NUMBER clues and it seems the classifier basically ended up counting way more NUMBER NUMBER than NUMBER NUMBER clues and no others made it into the list i thought it was looking for clues with values in between apparently it found none that weren t exactly NUMBER NUMBER there s a brief discussion of this before the definition of max_discriminators all clues with prob min_spamprob and max_spamprob are saved in min and max lists and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of clues in the longer list whatever remains of the longer list if anything is then fed into the nbest heap too but no more than max_discriminators of them in no case do more than max_discriminators clues enter into the final probability calculation but all of the min and max lists go into the list of clues else you d have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual review is needed in your specific case the excess of clues in the longer max_spamprob list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap and that s why you didn t see anything other than NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER before adding these special lists the outcome when faced with many NUMBER NUMBER and NUMBER NUMBER clues was too often a coin toss whichever flavor just happened to appear max_discriminators NUMBER NUMBER times first determined the final outcome that sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues this happened to be the longest one but there were quite a few similar ones i just beat it wink a tokenization scheme that folds case and ignores punctuation and strips a trailing s from words and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams turned up a low probability very long spam with a list of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER clues and NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER clues yikes i wonder if there s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the html it was heavily marked up html with ads in the sidebar but the body text was a serious discussion of oo and soft coding with lots of highly technical words as clues including zope and zeo no matter how often it says zope it gets only one NUMBER NUMBER clue from doing so ditto for zeo in contrast html markup has many unique words that get NUMBER NUMBER btw this is a clear case where the assumption of conditionally independent word probabilities is utterly bogus e g the probability that body appears in a message is highly correlated with the prob of br appearing by treating them as independent naive bayes grossly misjudges the probability that both appear and the only thing you get in return is something that can actually be computed wink read the what about html section in URL from the very start i ve been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at URL and html decorations have so far been too strong a clue to justify ignoring it in that specific context i haven t done anything geared toward personal email including the case of non mailing list email that happens to go through URL i d prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora the full test results with and without html tag stripping is included in the what about html comment block but as the comment block also says xxx so if another way is found to slash the f n rate the decision here xxx not to strip html from html only msgs should be revisited and we ve since done several things that gave significant f n rate reductions i should test that again now are there any minable but unmined header lines in your corpus left almost all of them apart from mime decorations that appear in both headers and bodies like content type the only header lines the base tokenizer looks at now are subject from x mailer and organization or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make progress there i would need different data yes my ham is too polluted with mailman header decorations which i may or may not be able to clean out but fudging the data is a mortal sin and i haven t changed a byte so far and my spam too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it in particular i have to skip to and received headers now and i suspect they re going to be very valuable in real life for example i don t even catch undisclosed recipients in the to header now no sorry these were all of the following structure multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website ah that explains why the html tags didn t get stripped i d again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that they d get stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss wink this seems confused jeremy didn t use my trained classifier pickle he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora i think it s still corpus size i reported on tests i ran with random samples of NUMBER spams and NUMBER hams from my corpus that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting on sets of those sizes and while that did harm the error rates the error rates i saw were still much better than jeremy reported when using NUMBER of each ah a full test run just finished on the tokenization scheme that folds case and ignores punctuation and strips a trailing s from words and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams this is the code tokenize everything in the body lastw for w in word_re findall text n len w make sure this range matches in tokenize_word if NUMBER n NUMBER if w NUMBER s w w NUMBER yield w if lastw yield lastw w lastw w elif n NUMBER lastw for t in tokenize_word w yield t where word_re re compile r w xNUMBER xff this at least doubled the process size over what s done now it helped the f n rate significantly but probably hurt the f p rate the f p rate is too low with only NUMBER hams per run to be confident about changes of such small absolute magnitude NUMBER NUMBER is a single message in the f p table false positive percentages NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER tied NUMBER NUMBER

 before we get too far down this road what do people think of creating a spambayes package containing classifier and tokenizer this is just to minimize clutter in site packages guido too early imo if you mean to leave the various other tools out guido of it well i mentioned classifier and tokenize only because i thought they were the only importable modules the rest represent script level code right guido if and when we package this perhaps we should use barry s trick guido from the email package for making the package itself the toplevel guido dir of the distribution rather than requiring an extra directory guido level just so the package can be a subdir of the distro that would be perfect i tried in the naive way last night but wound up with all py files in the package which wasn t my intent skip ,0

 tim one effect of getting rid of mincount is that it latches on more strongly to rare clues now and those can be unique to the corpus trained on e g one trained ham says gryndlplyx and a followup new ham quotes it this may be a systematic bias in the testing procedure in real life msgs come ordered in time say there s a thread that spans n messages on URL in our testing setup we ll train on a random sampling throughout its whole lifetime and test likewise new ham in the middle of this thread gets benefit from that we trained on msgs that appeared both before and after it in real life it s quite plausible that the f p rate would rise without this effect in real life at any given time some number of ham threads will just be starting their lives and if they re at all unusual the trained data will know little to nothing about them ,0

 followups to spambayes URL please unless you re specifically concerned about some particular bit of email policy for URL ok after much fiddling with and tweaking of etc exim eximNUMBER conf and etc exim local_scan py on URL i am fairly confident that i can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment s notice for the record here s how it all works eximNUMBER conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file etc exim harvest does not exist that is any junk mail condition that can be detected by exim acls access control lists is handled entirely in eximNUMBER conf the message is rejected before it ever gets to local_scan py this covers such diverse cases as message from known spammer reject after every rcpt to command no message id header and NUMBER bit chars in subject both rejected after the message headers body are read the main things i have changed in the absence of etc exim harvest are don t check for NUMBER bit chars in from header the vast majority of hits for this test were bounces from some asian isp the remaining hits should be handled by spamassassin do header sender verification ie ensure that there s a verifiable email address in at least one of from reply to and sender as late as possible because it requires dns lookups which can be slow and can also make messages that should have been rejected merely be deferred if those dns lookups timeout if etc exim harvest exists then the behaviour of all of those acls in eximNUMBER conf suddenly changes instead of rejecting recipients or messages they add an x reject header to the message this header is purely for internal use it records the name of the folder to which the rejected message should be saved and also gives the smtp error message which should ultimately be used to reject the message thus those messages will now be seen by local_scan py which now looks for the x reject header if found it uses the folder name specified there to save the message and then rejects it with the smtp error message also given in x reject currently x reject is retained in saved messages if a message was not tagged with x reject then local_scan py runs the usual virus and spam checks namely my homebrew scan for attachments with filenames that look like windows executables and a run through spamassassin the logic is basically this if virus folder virus else run through spamassassin if score NUMBER NUMBER folder rejected spam elif score NUMBER NUMBER folder caught spam finally local_scan py writes the message to the designated folder by far the biggest folder will be accepted the server handles NUMBER NUMBER incoming messages per day of which maybe NUMBER NUMBER are junk mail oops just realized i haven t written the code that actually saves the message d ohh also haven t written anything to discriminate personal email which i must do sigh finally the big catch waiting until after you ve read the message headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic because certain broken mtas including those used by some spammers don t consider a NUMBERxx after data as a permanent error but keep retrying d ohh this is a minor annoyance currently where a fair amount of stuff is rejected at rcpt to time but in harvest mode everything with the exception of people probing for open relays will be rejected at data time so i have cooked up something called the asbl or automated sender blacklist this is just a berkeley db file that maps sender_ip sender_address to an expiry time when local_scan rejects a message from sender_ip sender_address for whatever reason including finding an x reject header added by an acl in eximNUMBER conf it adds a record to the asbl with an expiry time NUMBER hours in the future meanwhile there s an acl in eximNUMBER conf that checks for records in the asbl if there s a record for the current sender_ip sender_address that hasn t expired yet we reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or body the downside of this from the point of view of corpus collection is that if some jerk is busily spamming URL one smtp connection per address we will most likely only get one copy this is a win if you re just thinking about reducing server load and bandwidth but i m not sure if it s helpful for training spam detectors tim happy harvesting greg greg ward gward python net URL budget s in the red let s tax religion dead kennedys ,0

url URL date not supplied we re trying to decide if fogbugz NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER should support custom fields historically i am opposed to custom fields in principle because they get abused people add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to harvard end result people don t enter bugs which is much much worse than not capturing all that information you can always page fault to get the information if the original report forgot it rather than having a field in every bug where you enter the version numbers of every dll on your machine this is an actual customer request information which is likely to be relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs why not just have the programmer assignee look at the bug first and if they think it might be dll version related only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking for the dll info similarly it s always tempting to add a field in which you ask for the os version in which the bug occurred this sounds logical but trust me adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing only reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first place only a small percentage of bugs are really os dependant and you can always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be relevant but then how do you search for say all bugs which only happen on windows NUMBERse aha you can t ever even with the custom field because not every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system so this search doesn t make sense in the first place the info wasn t captured do a full text search for NUMBERse and you ll find some of them life is imperfect life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of information a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in ram on the computer in question and while you re at it a photograph of the tester s workspace but the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_ which all else being equal takes priority over making it easy to find them i have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking package was so high ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the system because they didn t know what all those fields were the _real_ bug tracking happened in email post its and hallway conversations great a pretty common question we get on the customer service line is does fogbugz support custom fields rather than giving our usual answer no on purpose over the last few weeks i ve been saying can you please tell me what fields you would need we re trying to decide whether to implement that feature in NUMBER NUMBER and we want to know why people need it the interesting thing is almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in fogbugz _ and the other ones in my educated opinion shouldn t be fields and in fact our existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields one of our biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company and i myself wanted to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design but i didn t and they never needed it even though they had been keeping track of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields and they are happy and keep buying more site licenses but the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in our product gosh even filemaker has custom fields righto it s true and who am i to tell my customers they are wrong one person who i was talking to yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a built in field for this would have made their database confusing and inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved but it s still rude of me to tell customers that we don t have that feature _for their own good_ even though it usually is and we re losing some sales because of it sigh i guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so hard to use that people don t use it at least we won t lose any sales NUMBER URL ,0

url URL date NUMBER NUMBER NUMBERtNUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER so i was researching the history of the tilde because d told me that her company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any url with a tilde in it presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with remarkable accuracy a personal site and apparently her employer believes that reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time which to be honest is probably accurate given the nature of her work but never mind that i don t want to talk about corporate politics i want to talk about the tilde every command line loving geek will tell you that stands for NUMBER home directory NUMBER and cd will take you to your home directory cd username will take you to someone else s except on mac os x where it will take you to their public file sharing directory it is from this heritage that we can trace the present day practice of using tildes in urls to denote personal pages since one single system wide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory or more commonly now that apache has taken over the world in their public_html subdirectory except on mac os x where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to http localhost username you re actually being served files from that user s sites directory within their home directory but i don t want to talk about mac os x i want to talk about the tilde as with so many other things i find that jukka korpela NUMBER is the expert in this field jukka is no doubt a member of my karass NUMBER a word which google old habits die hard NUMBER feels is best explained by the personal site of eugene wallingford which like jukka s home page can not be referenced without a tilde in fact jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in urls NUMBER a treatise which i feel obliged to point out contains a tilde in its url clearly the tilde is underappreciated digging further we find this post of jukka s from NUMBER NUMBER in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all but rather an odd character called the overline presumably to balance out the underline if indeed those sorts of things require balance there is balance in the universe to be sure but i am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard no matter the tilde was the tilde so that spanish typing types could type the ntilde now referenced in html as the named entity ntilde but somewhere along the line it morphed into a general purpose character with all sorts of geeky uses digging even further it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for NUMBER then an alternate for and its life as an overline replacement came even later jukka confirms this NUMBER and adds a timeline NUMBER for NUMBER for NUMBER for overline then june NUMBER NUMBER the watershed moment in an xNUMBER committee meeting when it was proposed NUMBER as exclusively a tilde in usa to appease share NUMBER i can find no further reference as to what this acronym means or what this committee meeting was about the next reference isn t until NUMBER when

groups NUMBER we find a reprint of a NUMBER william safire yes _that_ william safire article on language NUMBER in which we learn that is officially pronounced NUMBER squiggle NUMBER this is confirmed by the jargon dictionary NUMBER to this very day i m not sure this is useful but i just thought it was cool to see william safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various ascii characters as early as august NUMBER tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem NUMBER in july NUMBER kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde NUMBER in february NUMBER an editor s note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that fidonet supported ascii characters space through tilde NUMBER as early as january NUMBER less used the tilde to denote lines past eof NUMBER as early as july NUMBER troff supported the tilde NUMBER in november NUMBER a mod sources post refers to bourne shell enhancements history tilde job control NUMBER as early as january NUMBER tilde was included on the

there are gaps what happened at that watershed meeting in NUMBER how did the tilde rise to prominence in the NUMBERs when did it become a synonym for NUMBER home directory NUMBER when did it migrate into the world of web servers to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web sites i don t know and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing my research a

could but i don t use the desktop at all never have on any system and i don t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because i personally find them awkward ymmv if you must use windows the first step towards a productive system is managing your start menu i use the main level of the start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most common programs NUMBER control panel NUMBER NUMBER mozilla NUMBER NUMBER emacs NUMBER NUMBER dos home NUMBER dos work NUMBER dos incoming each of which gives me a command line but in different directories NUMBER python NUMBER NUMBER ie also explorer home explorer work explorer incoming which open explorer windows in various useful directories the same directories as the dos shortcuts only with the shift key held down and yes i intentionally set it up so that went to my work

netscape NUMBER NUMBER paint shop pro query tool odbc NUMBER vmware NUMBER word NUMBER all other submenus except startup are removed from the programs menu yes delete accessories do you honestly ever use it if so it s probably a sign of a larger productivity problem things which never need to be run manually like winzip and quicktime are removed from the programs menu maintaining a clean programs menu is an ongoing struggle but well worth it on most modern keyboards there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys otherwise ctrl esc always works menu NUMBER gives me a new command prompt in my work directory menu p n runs netscape NUMBER for compatibility testing in my day job ugh mozilla and emacs are almost always open but i quit lesser used applications as soon as i m done using them mostly because my laptop doesn t have a lot of memory i install cygwin NUMBER so that the command line is actually useful cygwin is a collection of windows ports of all your favorite unix utilities including mv cp scp ssh man tar less grep patch ncftp cvs and many others and bash which i don t use because i dislike how it handles windows pathnames i also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to NUMBER x NUMBER almost full screen at NUMBER x NUMBER and screen buffer size to NUMBER x NUMBER set window position at NUMBER x NUMBER and don t let the system position the window in mozilla i set my home page to about blank set internet search to search with google use tabbed browsing open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases always show the tab bar and load links in the background essential for weblog surfing you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background under scripts plugins i do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows i turn off the sidebar turn on the site navigation bar delete all pre installed bookmarks and create two bookmarks one which takes me to my webmail and another which takes me to my internal site search NUMBER from which i can find all other bookmarks i need in internet explorer i set my home page to the page to edit my weblog since that s the only thing i do in internet explorer alt tab back and forth between mozilla and ie is easier than ctrl pgup pgdown between tabs within mozilla since textareas in mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible i use emacs locally and vi remotely because the default behavior of emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable for instance editing a cgi script named foo cgi on a web server with emacs would generate a foo cgi backup file which is world readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks try this sometime on your favorite web site among other things my emacs file which is actually called _emacs on windows instructs emacs to store all backup files in a single directory d backup to treat all xml files as docbook all cgi scripts as python and all sql scripts as pl sql to use cygwin s bash shell for m x shell to use a single maximized frame with no menubar titled as the name of the current file to show column numbers to accept y and n for yes no questions not to blink not to beep and to close the current file when i press m w i use some weird

url URL date NUMBER NUMBER NUMBERtNUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER _clay shirky_ in praise of evolvable systems NUMBER this entire article could be rewritten to explain rss in fact let s do that if it were april fool s day the net s only official holiday and you wanted to design a NUMBER novelty format NUMBER to slip by the wNUMBERc as a joke it might look something like rss NUMBER NUMBERx NUMBER NUMBER it would specify limits on data values then remove them then specify required elements then make them optional thus silently breaking an unknown number of parsers around the world it would encourage use of entity encoded html in its most important element thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user it would ignore years of standards work in other fields committing such egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn t a guid and using an obsolete date format that couldn t easily be sorted by date its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core namespace without telling anyone or documenting them thus making it wholely resistant to dtd schema or validation of any kind after years of worldwide deployment it would completely reverse its add whatever you want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces which the spec would neither define nor elaborate on after adopting namespaces it would fail to deprecate any existing elements semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use it would also fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the same thing in two different ways thus ensuring mass confusion among producers and inconsistent behavior across consumers rss NUMBER NUMBERx and NUMBER NUMBER are the whoopee cushion and joy buzzer of syndication formats for anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata it s pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication format we have the worst one possible except of course for all the others the problem with that list of rss deficiencies is that it is also a list of necessities NUMBER rss has flourished in a way that no other syndication format has not despite many of these qualities but because of them the very weaknesses that make rss so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it possible in the first place removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened up rss to a whole new category of producer the weblogger allowing encoded html in description let publishers reuse both their existing content and the existing rss infrastructure without requiring them to produce valid xhtml which could be embedded directly into an xml document social mores rather than technical rules prevent producers from intentionally introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable display through unclosed html elements few publishing tools can produce real conforming guids and it doesn t matter because virtually all rss parsers are written in high level languages where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes and handling bytecodes as for dates by convention an rss document is laid out in reverse chronological order and no one seems to be clamoring for more flexibility furthermore its almost babyish xml syntax so far from any serious computational framework where are the namespaces where is the document type description why is the aggregators enforcement of conformity so lax made it possible for anyone wanting an rss feed to write one the effects of this ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts over the years to NUMBER do rss right NUMBER NUMBER most notably rss NUMBER NUMBER in the year NUMBER rss NUMBER NUMBER had three main benefits backward compatible with rss NUMBER NUMBER which was never widely deployed and which fell into obscurity as soon as the much simpler rss NUMBER NUMBER was introduced based on rdf specifically a serialization called rdf xml a spec which at the time and to this day continues to change or threaten to change two years later there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with parsers to consume rdf although many perl python net have third party rdf parsers in various states of development and conformance the release version is generally out of date cvs access is recommended you get the idea meanwhile rdf xml production tools are so inconsistent that even rdf experts recommend not using rdf tools to produce an rss NUMBER NUMBER feed if you want it to actually be read by any major rss aggregator despite the two year old promise of better tools NUMBER it is now the year NUMBER and i built my rss NUMBER NUMBER feed NUMBER in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the world NUMBER by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets into a textarea of an html form extensible through namespaces which as mentioned above have been haphazardly and poorly incorporated into rss NUMBER NUMBER where they appear to be flourishing evolvable formats NUMBER those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a thousand small ways NUMBER have three main characteristics that are germane to their eventual victories over strong centrally designed formats only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed my rss feed is an xml document produced by a template that i built in a textarea and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know nothing of xml and hack apart my feed with regular expressions the world is littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools if everyone in the world had a perfect rdf parser at their disposal it would be trivial to produce and consume all the world s metadata in rdf without such perfect tools both production and consumption instantly become nightmares there is no middle ground what is is wrong because evolvable formats have always been adapted to earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions they are always behind the times rss was being stretched with long descriptions optional titles and entity encoded html even before such practices were codified in the spec and long before all consumers could handle them no evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it faces finally orgel s rule named for the evolutionary biologist leslie orgel NUMBER NUMBER evolution is cleverer than you are NUMBER as with the list of rss s obvious deficiencies above it is easy to point out what is wrong with any evolvable system at any point in its life no one seeing rss NUMBER NUMBER and rss NUMBER NUMBER side by side could doubt that rss NUMBER NUMBER had the superior technology that it NUMBER did things right NUMBER however the ability to understand what is missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central group can design a better system in the long haul designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically evolvable formats start out weak and improve exponentially rss NUMBER NUMBER is not the perfect syndication format just the best one that s also currently practical infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition NUMBER URL NUMBER URL ,0

url URL date not supplied feedback from my posting NUMBER about fogbugz NUMBER setup fell into four categories why make setup reversable instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end there are a couple of things to understand here first of all even if you do everything in one batch at the end there s always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail and in that case a well behaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done there are well over NUMBER error messages in the string table for fogbugz setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant second it s not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake for example early in the fogbugz setup process we prompt you to create an account for fogbugz to use img URL fogbugz setup screenshot the account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account for example the password might not conform to the system password policy and different national versions of windows nt have different rules about accented letters in passwords betcha didn t know that it s better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later forcing the user to back up and fix it and even if you force the user to back up and fix it you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did before creating the account otherwise you ve left their system in an indeterminate state in any case i need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails i might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where i can display a useful error message and what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable well in order to upgrade fogbugz without requiring a reboot and we _never ever _require a reboot we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been keeping fogbugz files pinned down such as iis microsoft s web server so part one of the batch is stop iis now if part NUMBER fails for some reason it would be _extremely_ rude to leave iis not running and anyway it s not like i don t need to write the code for start iis for the end of the batch so the code to rollback stop iis is already written no big deal i just need to call it at the right place i think one reason that people think you should gather all the info and then do all the work is because with very large installation programs that are very slow this is a polite way to waste less of the user s time indeed even fogbugz setup does NUMBER of its work at the very end but the create account operation is so fast that principle simply doesn t apply here even our NUMBER of the work phase takes well under a minute most of which is spent waiting for iis to stop and start why did you use vc mfc surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself has admitted by now that delphi NUMBER is more productive first of all leave your language religious fanaticism at the usenet door somehow i managed to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious arguments are unbelievably boring secondly even if delphi were more productive the only pertinent question since i am writing the code is _what is more productive for joel spolsky_ and i don t know delphi at all but i know winNUMBER mfc and vc _really really well_ so while i might not outcode a good delphi programmer i would definitely outcode a completely inexperienced delphi programmer which is me certainly over a short NUMBER week project third many of the things i needed to do in this setup program are things like grant the logon as service privilege to an account this is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this is to search the microsoft knowlege base and the web in general when you search the web in general for how to do fancy things with windows nt what you find is about NUMBER c code maybe NUMBER vb code and NUMBER everything else yes i know i could translate the c code into delphi assuming i was a sophisticated delphi programmer not a completely inexperienced delphi programmer but that costs as much productivity as i would supposedly gain from your supposedly more productive programming language and fourth i already had about NUMBER of the code i needed for setup in mfc format from fogbugz NUMBER NUMBER setup and a library i ve been using for years to make wizards why make setup at all you already have your customers money good setup programs don t increase sales this was actually the smartest question and made me think the hardest i came up with three reasons decreased tech support cost this setup program will pay for itself over the life of the code delight my customers when i m trying to get them to upgrade to NUMBER NUMBER i want them to remember how painless the NUMBER NUMBER installation was so they won t hesitate because they are afraid to upgrade i m still using an old version of spamassassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective even though i know the new version is much better because i just can t bear the thought of another morning wasted the very memory of the first spamassassin installation all the little ssh windows some su ed trying to scroll through man pages and google groups accidentally hitting ctrl z in emacs to undo and having it suspend trying to guess why we can t get the mta to run procmail sorry it s too much if spamassassin was making money off of upgraders they would have lost my business because they don t have a setup program win reviews software reviewers always cast about for some kind of standardized way to rate software even when they are comparing apples and oranges and planets and NUMBERth century philosophers they always have a meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to pc games mainframe databases web site auction software and dna sequencing software and setup is always on their list a single flaw in setup is guaranteed to be mentioned in every review

the hood level of most cars their bodies often come crashing through windshields in collisions more often than not crashes like these damage the vehicle the people inside and the animal sometimes they are fatal in NUMBER latti said there were six moose related fatalities after that when the number of moose hunting permits went from NUMBER NUMBER to NUMBER NUMBER there were less maine had three moose related fatalities in NUMBER one in NUMBER and two this year so far said stephen mccausland spokesman for the maine public safety department pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car did not become part of that statistic early on election day but she also feels cheated by the whole situation after all her car was totaled on the morning of the accident pierce was taking her two children and a neighbor s son to school in her NUMBER dodge dynasty she said she was going along at about NUMBER mph on a well traveled road when a moose came out of nowhere by the time my brain could see moose he was part of my windshield she said pierce is well aware of the law so as she sat in the ambulance with the children being treated for cuts and bruises she thought about the moose but the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal with it so she said she wasn t able to follow up on the animal until later that day when she inquired she was told the deputy on the scene gave the fully racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor her neighbor she said subsequently offered her the moose for the NUMBER it took him to carry it away money she didn t think she should spend by the time she contacted the attorney general s office on nov NUMBER to complain about the deputy giving her moose away the neighbor s price had gone up another NUMBER for the cost of butchering NUMBER pounds of meat and when she called york county chief deputy maurice ouellette to complain that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer s fault that she didn t have it ouellette told her he could not give her cash and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in york county at that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore but wanting money ouellette said that conversation and a similar one she had with york county sheriff phil cote left pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the moose but the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to other officials it s the officer s discretion said latti and if the officer feels the person can t immediately remove the animal he s got to think of public safety and other people on the roadway if someone is worried about her children in her car the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask is if she wants the moose maine state police trooper jeremy forbes said when he arrives at accidents that involve a serious injury to a person the issue of who gets the animal deer or moose becomes secondary the priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital he said if they are really hurt and going to the hospital the animal can t wait so we ll probably give it to the next person who stops by this is not comforting to pierce she said the deputy could have come to the ambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose with her boyfriend a hunter nearby she could have easily taken care of the animal herself she knows her situation is probably a lost cause but she hopes other people especially other women do not have the same experience what about people who don t know the law she said standing up for my rights has just been a big headache staff writer giselle goodman can be contacted at NUMBER NUMBER or at ggoodman URL to unsubscribe from this

the material appended below comes from martin gardner s book _fads and fallacies in the name of science_ revised and expanded edition published in NUMBER by dover publications inc new york city bill bennetta _________________________________________________ m ost pseudo scientists have a number of characteristics in common first and most important of these traits is that cranks work in almost total isolation in the sense of having no fruitful contacts with fellow researchers the modern crank insists that his isolation is not desired on his part it is due he claims to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new ideas the modern pseudo scientist stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated he works in isolation he does not send his findings to the recognized journals or if he does they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent in most cases the crank is not well enough informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance to a significant study as a consequence he finds himself excluded the journals and societies and almost universally ignored by the competent workers in his field in fact the reputable scientist does not even know of the crank s existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through non academic channels or unless the scientist makes a hobby of collecting crank literature the eccentric is forced therefore to tread a lonely way he speaks before organizations he himself has founded contributes to journals he himself may edit and until recently publishes books only when he or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed privately a second characteristic of the pseudo scientist which greatly strengthens his isolation is a tendency toward paranoia there are five ways in which the sincere pseudo scientist s paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited NUMBER he considers himself a genius NUMBER he regards his colleagues without exception as ignorant blockheads everyone is out of step except himself frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of stupidity dishonesty or other base motives if they ignore him he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable if they retaliate in kind this strengthens his delusion that he is battling scoundrels NUMBER he believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated against NUMBER he has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the greatest scientists and the best established theories when newton was the outstanding name in physics eccentric works in that science were violently anti newton today with einstein the father symbol of authority a crank theory of physics is likely to attack einstein in the name of newton NUMBER he often has a tendency to write in a complex jargon in many cases making use of terms and phrases he himself has coined terry w colvin sierra vista arizona usa forteanNUMBER URL alternate forteanNUMBER URL home page URL sites fortean times mystic s haven tlcb u s message text formatting usmtf program member thailand laos cambodia brotherhood tlcb mailing list tlcb web site URL vietnam veterans allies cia nsa and steenkeen contractors are welcome to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe URL your use of yahoo groups is subject to URL ,0

of technology at google to keep live query g rated google filters out sex related searches though less successfully with foreign languages despite its geographic and ethnic diversity the world is spending much of its time thinking about the same things the same topic areas bubble to the top celebrities current events products and computer downloads it s amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what they are searching for said greg rae one of three members of google s logs team which is responsible for building storing and protecting the data record google s following _ it is the most widely used search engine _ has given mr rae a worldview from his cubicle since october NUMBER he has been able to reel off anthrax in several languages including milzbrand in german and carbonchio in italian he says he can also tell which countries took their recent elections seriously brazil and germany because of the frenzy of searches he notes that the globalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are far flung in origin nokia sony bmw ferrari ikea and microsoft judging from google s data some sports events stir interest almost everywhere the tour de france wimbledon the melbourne cup horse race and the world series were among the top NUMBER sports related searches last year it also becomes obvious just how familiar american movies music and celebrities are to searchers across the globe two years ago a google engineer named lucas pereira noticed that searches for britney spears had declined indicating what he thought must be a decline in her popularity from that observation grew google zeitgeist a listing of the top gaining and declining queries of each week and month glancing over google zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in

group one of whose members was videotaped beating her young daughter in indiana and fentanyl the narcotic gas used in the moscow raid to rescue hostages taken by chechen rebels in late october the long lasting volume of searches involving her name has made britney spears something of a benchmark for the logs team it has helped them understand how news can cause spikes in searches as it did when

at NUMBER NUMBER am local time within two minutes earthquake related searches jumped to NUMBER a minute from almost none with a concentration in the us pacific northwest on sept NUMBER searches for the world trade center pentagon and cnn shot up immediately after the attacks over the next few days nostradamus became the top search query fuelled by a rumour that nostradamus had predicted the trade center s destruction but the most trivial events may also register on google s sensitive cultural seismic meter the logs team came to work one morning to find that carol brady maiden name had surged to the top of the charts curious they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they were neatly grouped in five spikes each one starting at NUMBER minutes after the hour as the logs were passed through the office employees were perplexed why would there be a surge in interest in a character from the NUMBERs sitcom the brady bunch but the data could only reflect patterns not explain them that is a paradox of a google log it does not capture social phenomena per se but merely the shadows they cast across the internet the most interesting part is why said amit patel who has been a member of the logs team you can t interpret it unless you know what else is going on in the world so what had gone on on april NUMBER NUMBER that night the million dollar question on the game show who wants to be a millionaire had been what was carol brady s maiden name seconds after the show s host posed the question thousands flocked to google to search for the answer tyler producing

s query data respond to television movies and radio but the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences one of google s strengths is its predictive power flagging trends before they hit the radar of other media as such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or retailers google is quiet about what if any plans it has for commercialising its vast store of query information there is tremendous opportunity with this data mr silverstein said the challenge is defining what we want to do google currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data because of privacy concerns searches are logged by time of day originating ip address information that can be used to link searches to a specific computer and the sites on which the user clicked people tell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly _ viagra pregnancy scares fraud facelifts what is interesting in the aggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an

one of the main strands of this modernisation is to have all stations on a retained basis at night basically this means that the fire station will be unmanned and in the event of a fire the fire fighters will be summonsed by pagers the same way that they currently are in a lot of rural regions the main reason for this is that fewer fires occur at night however the majority of fatalities in fires do occur at night and the recent deaths during the fire fighters strike all occurred at night over half of these happened in areas currently covered by retained crews who aren t on strike and would appear to give a grim foreshadowing of what may be to come currently one of the conditions for being in a retained crew is that you must live work within one mile of the station how they will apply this to whole time fire fighters is still unclear a good friend of mine is a station officer in hampshire and currently lives NUMBER miles from his station so how he ll respond to fire calls at night is a mystery and i can t see many fire fighters living within a mile of some of the inner london stations dave to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe URL your use of yahoo groups is subject to URL ,0

these guides on your computer s hard disk as other people will be ordering these guides from you paying you for them and you will need to email the guides to the new buyers step NUMBER from the list of names above delete the name and address of the person shown under guide NUMBER and replace that slot with the name and address of the person from guide NUMBER s slot be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown check the address again step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with the name and address from guide NUMBER s slot step NUMBER delete name and address under guide NUMBER and replace with your own name and address this step is how your own name and address is entered into the list of names to receive orders

names on the list with the names of your spouse kids relatives and friends that might seem to you like a clever move because new buyers will be sending their money to these people but that move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit what will benefit you most is having people who will send out emails seek new buyers and provide assistance to new buyers if the people you slip into that list aren t going to be sending new emails you re only hurting yourself by effectively closing down the program with your name on top of the list of the names that you have inserted there wouldn t be new buyers coming in so your sly maneuver will gain you exactly zero furthermore if you have done the work and your name has worked its way to further down the list by then you deserve the rewards and earnings from that effort and it would be unethical for anyone to remove your name for whatever reason don t do it to others remember honesty reaps the reward you may have a concern that after sending the total NUMBER to the five people on the list that one of the people will just take your money and not send you the guide well rest assured as we said above it s to our benefit to have you as a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find new buyers so don t think the people on the list will try to cheat you or to stiff you for NUMBER NUMBER the people on the list would rather have you working hard because your effort will benefit them as well as you later on when other buyers send you the order to buy the guides fulfill your end of the deal by sending the ordered guide to the buyer don t cheat provide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit end of summary rest of message with easy to use email tools and opt in email success in this business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary people who may not have done any internet marketing before and the earnings potential is staggering read this email to the end follow what it says and you will not worry whether a recession is coming or not or whether or not you can afford to buy that new car or home that you have been looking for yes i know what you are thinking i never responded to one of

the people you buy these guides from will assist and advise you how to get the large number of email addresses that you need to send the new email containing your name and address in return when

buyers will buy from you this is no different than customer service in the retail or the bricks and mortars business available guides the reason for the cash is not because this is illegal or somehow wrong it is simply about time time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved etc concealing it is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you order each guide by its number name only always send a single NUMBER bill u s currency for each guide checks not accepted make sure the cash is hidden by wrapping it in at least NUMBER sheets of paper on one of those sheets of paper write the number the name of the guide you are ordering your email address and your name and postal address be sure to address the envelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to mail the envelope place your order for these guides now from the name and address list shown at the beginning of this email ________________________________________________ your success guidelines if you do not receive at least NUMBER orders for guide NUMBER within NUMBER weeks continue sending emails until you do two to three weeks after you receive NUMBER orders you should receive NUMBER orders or more for guide NUMBER if not continue advertising or sending emails until you do once you have received NUMBER or more orders for guide NUMBER you can see the program is working and cash should continue coming in this is important to remember continue to assist new buyers with advice and instruction on how to send out more emails you can keep track of progress by

found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labelled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the NUMBER year old woman there was over NUMBER NUMBER dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the

really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did

plan below said it would give it a try you will be glad you did thanks and good luck you won t need luck just keep reading don t delete this first read about how a NUMBER year old made NUMBER NUMBER see below as seen on national tv this is the media report parents of NUMBER year old find NUMBER NUMBER cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her NUMBER year old sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash five dollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubber banded in labeled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the NUMBER year old woman there was over NUMBER NUMBER dollars in that bag that s more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered he came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via e mail a type of report to e mail addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past NUMBER months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever NUMBER year old the e mail letter listed NUMBER addresses and contained instructions to send one NUMBER dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five dollar bills within NUMBER weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the NUMBER address list i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the e mail the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his video game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing NUMBER bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had NUMBER magazine and about NUMBER envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the e mail the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework he had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the NUMBER bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didn t want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraid the reporting news team examined and investigated the so called chain letter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain letter at all in fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title NUMBER section NUMBER and NUMBER or title NUMBER section NUMBER in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume NUMBER sections NUMBER and NUMBER which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every five dollar bill that he received

marshallese name for wake island claiming to represent the mid pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france presse the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation a honolulu based attorney created the kingdom of enenkio in the early NUMBERs it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel hermios which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputed URL disconnected as of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER the purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the kingdom of enenkio while i am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the kingdom of enenkio i am aghast at how distorted erroneous and misleading the article is as a consequence of my service to his majesty king remios and the people of enenkio i am obligated to respond to incidents such as this i will respectfully offer the following line by line correction for your convenience your text will be set off with in color dom is located on karitane island and now includes the taongi atoll in the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the south pacific NUMBER miles south of tahiti comment the construction of this statement implies the marshall islands are in the south pacific ocean NUMBER miles south of tahiti in which case a reader may be misled correction dom is located on karitane island in the south pacific NUMBER miles south of tahiti and now includes taongi atoll in the northern atolls of the marshall islands in the north pacific however the marshall islands government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of two organizations comment just because the rmi government has condemned the fraudulent assertions of enenkio does that make it true why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized and documented time and again for fraud abuse of human rights outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made what purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government namely the dom and sister nation the kingdom of enenkio the marshallese name for wake island comment nothing could be further from the truth we cannot speak for dom but as for the kingdom we don t even know what being a sister nation means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign his majesty king remios the sovereign of enenkio and eneen kio atoll and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism doesn t anybody check sources anymore correction the kingdom of enenkio is an independent sovereign state and the same could be said for dom claiming to represent the mid pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in agence france presse comment the government of the kingdom of enenkio represents the people of enenkio who are forced to live in exile from eneen kio atoll lands and seas that played a significant role in marshallese culture for perhaps NUMBER years furthermore an article in agence france presse has no merit as it was authored by a source in the marshall islands government my preceding comments apply the kingdom of enenkio is not now and never has been engaged in an investment scam we have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of enenkio but also will positively impact people around the globe in fact we are currently working with a former nasa astronaut one tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism doesn t anybody check sources anymore the marshall islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation comment the kingdom of enenkio has made no fraudulent claims of which i am aware and in my post i am responsible for all published information i would personally caution any countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of nations companies or publications if i had credible proof to that effect however my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any rmi ministry source furthermore the rmi has repeatedly attacked the credibility of his majesty king hermios who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under marshallese custom of over NUMBER NUMBER of the land in the marshall islands including recent attempts to sequester him against his will we believe some officials in the rmi are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till to perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism a honolulu based attorney created the kingdom of enenkio in the early NUMBERs comment mr moore is not an attorney though he was living in honolulu in the early NUMBERs correction the kingdom of enenkio was established by decree of the owner of eneen kio atoll a k a enen kio halcyon disclerta wake and NUMBER NUMBER other names iroijlaplap murjel hermios who then was paramount chief of the northern ratak atolls he passed away in december NUMBER and was fully recognized by the rmi government he declared the sovereign state of enenkio in NUMBER whereupon the people chose him as their king over eneen kio atoll ratified the constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy it was based on a power of attorney agreement with marshall islands paramount chief mursel sic hermios which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf correction the establishment of the kingdom of enenkio was made possible by murjel s appointment of mr robert moore the adopted brother of hermios alab of taongi atoll and a private citizen to the post of minister plenipotentiary the document of appointment was also a special power of attorney which granted mr moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the united states from eneen kio atoll and establish an independent state on hermios and the people s behalf the marshall islands high court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified which the kingdom has disputed comment since when is a special power of attorney an agreement the marshall islands high court has no record or knowledge of the special power of attorney except as has been publicized by the kingdom of enenkio and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over eneen kio atoll which lies over NUMBER miles north of lawful rmi boundaries the rmi has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of eneen kio atoll because the atoll by any name you choose was not incorporated into the rmi when it formed its government in NUMBER nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act law mandate or otherwise of any present or former iroijlaplap or monarch of eneen kio and any statement to the contrary is false fraudulent and irresponsible finally i suggest you as a journalist or publisher do a little more research not only into establishment and development of the kingdom of enenkio but into the prehistoric history and more recent u s invasion of eneen kio atoll properly named by marshallese centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries then i invite you to our embassy in honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above all of which exist in hard copy not in cyberspace and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site be sure to view the documents at our resource center which show in many cases full color digitized letters of correspondence with the NUMBER or so states in the world many of which are first world in closing i would

cited above in the article skip to next file top of page june NUMBER NUMBER sir the following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the kingdom of enenkio thank you for spelling enenkio

fantasy island disconnected as of NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER response to the author i am unable to locate the melchizedek press release you cited indicating that taongi was leased in NUMBER under a treaty with representatives of the kingdom of enenkio such an act would be impossible and implausible as enenkio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over taongi atoll in the marshall islands further more melchizedek dom is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government the kingdom of enenkio did enter into a treaty with dom on the NUMBERth day of september NUMBER but it did not convey a lease of land it declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments however a prior agreement signed in may NUMBER which had nothing to do with the kingdom of enenkio transferred mr robert moore s rights to develop taongi from mr moore to dom it did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence this was made possible because mr moore is the alab one class of landowner of taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to taongi atoll from the principal landowner iroijlaplap paramount chief murjel hermios who was aware of and supported the transaction consideration if any under the agreement was personally retained by mr moore who is also the adopted brother of hermios now please understand that while mr moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf and that of the future use and development of taongi which would have generated an income to iroijlaplap hermios mr moore wears another hat as minister plenipotentiary of the kingdom of enenkio iroijlaplap hermios also wore he died in december NUMBER NUMBER the same date of your article other hats one as first monarch king of the kingdom of enenkio and one as owner in allodium of eneen kio atoll a k a enen kio halcyon disclerta wake and several other names for you to state the kingdom of enenkio is another only in cyberspace country as you did in the above article is not only a completely and categorically false statement but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of enenkio and it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon his majesty king hermios the sovereign of enenkio and eneen kio atoll and an inexplicable and

government admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism appears to have violated the laws of nature and the law of nations in taking possession of sovereign property in the northern ratak state which

sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many marshallese because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation these scars on marshallese society have not healed thus a current state of adversity exists following four years of attempts to cause the united states to evaluate the plight of the marshallese of the northern ratak imposed by its actions with respect to wake island the government of enenkio on behalf of the marshallese king issued the state of war a declaration and broadcast it to the world the people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war not by virtue of being kept in but by virtue of being kept out it was through this pragmatic initiative that the kingdom of enenkio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the ratak paramount chief king murjel hermios in retrospect the declaration has had little visible effect while a state of adversity does exist the hope for american recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon the kingdom of enenkio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations the kingdom of enenkio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the marshallese people while the kingdom of enenkio continues to seek accountability of the u s congress to obey its own laws to conform to the un charter conventions of the united nations relating to self determination preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses it believes accountability requires the u s to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity the refusal of the u s to meet its obligations even to the extent that a simple

reveal that the multiple landings by united states warships en route to the philippines on war missions and subsequent congressional action were the sole basis of the u s claim the motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the east such a station was never established at wake island it was destined to become a military installation however formal protests of the seizure was sent to the u s president by the german consul in the marshall islands and some measure of correspondence followed but since the u s abandoned

continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership upon the basis of events and actions by the united states the administration of the kingdom of enenkio by virtue of the

marshallese civilization and for at least NUMBER years prior to the NUMBER fiasco note these facts and validity of the hermios claim are a matter of historical record not a fabrication NUMBER investigate and or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and u s policy past and present or the lack thereof with regard to the role of enenkio note it is my understanding wake was decommissioned after the so called processing of thousands of south vietnamese refugees in the late NUMBERs NUMBER reflect on the contrasting history of u s occupation war technological advances in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind NUMBER respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king s claim of allodial title the declaration of rights of the citizens of enenkio to self determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner NUMBER bring to light u s strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation offensive defensive weapon systems clandestine military research environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there note congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of wake island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects NUMBER fully disclose to the people of the united states u s strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to eneen kio atoll by king hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time honored and respected marshallese matriarchal traditions disregard for human rights protected under international law united nations charter and conventions and the u s compact with the marshall islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century note u s apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the hawaiian monarchy the prior year and the return of the hawaiian island kaho olawe also of religious significance has set precedents for the action demanded by enenkio citizens parting shot what truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general the u s federal government more precisely which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe but considering its present source it is downright alarming it is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years letters reports forms published articles press releases legal notices documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing king hermios have escaped official response from officers of the u s federal government our not too distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western civilized nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of manifest destiny which clearly marked american foreign policy of a century ago if this current trend signifies a resurgence it can only be considered a giant leap backward considering the flimsy record of american attempts at fixing up the world the title of ownership and inheritance of eneen kio atoll pre dates formation of the united states by two centuries or more it is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor people have a right to know the media a responsibility to show them in conclusion i reiterate that our focus from my point of view is one not so much of opposition to the ominous might of u s political philosophy and military prowess but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past supporting restoration of human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of god given individual rights thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry top of page november NUMBER NUMBER news release in a bid to regain occupation of that

 welcome to ghetto america yes you heard me i said ghetto america what is ghetto america i m glad you asked before i go on please be warned this explanation may not sit well with many of you however it is no less true ghetto america is a society of individuals comprised primarily of african americans who represent the impoverished and often unpolished side of black america confused i shall explain further have you ever passed by a typical ghetto community namely the projects and noticed an unusual amount of fancy cars parked throughout that particular neighborhood and wondered how could that be or maybe you have been to a shopping mall and noticed an unusual amount of young teen looking black women carrying infants or pushing baby carriages and often with a toddler in tow perhaps you also noticed that there was rarely any male companion accompanying them if you paid close attention you might have also noticed the absence of the all important wedding band missing from their respective ring fingers and of course we have all heard stories of young black men carrying guns and knives allegedly mugging robbing and carjacking people of all sorts did you know that many young african american women refuse to date african american males if they do not own or possess an automobile in fact many young black women prefer only to date individuals who represent the subversive side of society commonly known as thugs or street hustlers also did you know that many young african american males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while living in government housing better known as the projects rather than move away purchase new homes save or even make investments attention this is not another boyz in the hood story these newly distinguished black generation xers are suffering through utter chaos baby makers loser choosers welfare abusers images of my america is a collection of observations and commentary as told through the eyes of a young african american male who experienced and perpetuated many of the truths that many in black america and the world in general would have you believe do not exist it is a riveting expose that sheds light on the oppressive and often discriminatory nature of mainstream american society a society that has nurtured the rampant disregards for self respect and enlightenment that many young african american men and women currently suffer from the writer supports his arguments with direct references to the overwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to raise children with many being teens themselves and the foolish criteria that is utilized when choosing their mates oftentimes being based on nothing more than the young black male s tough or cool neighborhood reputation the author also identifies the self destructive and often criminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily basis like refusing to pursue higher education carrying guns robbing stealing selling drugs driving fancy cars and wearing expensive jewelry the negative and self debasing behavior committed by both males and females is due in large part to a lack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless homes these poor choices and behavioral disorders coupled with the unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in the form of welfare abuse and over crowded prison populations are the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty and lack of direction that currently exists in young black america today to learn more about this dynamic self contained society visit URL and reserve your copy today to request an excerpt please email books URL buy this soon to be best seller now URL ,1

 foreword after thirty three years of being a black man living in ghetto america an environment notorious for danger crime and poverty i have made startling discoveries involving young african american men and women who comprise what i have come to define as the black generation x i have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young african americans from the general definition of generation x aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed baby boomers it s important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young african american culture i have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth childhood and young adult life taken from a web site entitled generation x created and maintained by the colorado college the definition is as follows we are a group of people born between NUMBER and NUMBER we are individuals who live for the here and now like to experiment and who require immediate results we are typically selfish and cynical and depend a lot on our parents we question authority and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations it s that simple it seems we have come to be called xer s simply because we represent something negative to our elders we may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings of course they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility or actually their fault our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse we are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school it appears we have little hope for the future no jobs no homes and basically no money are almost expected of us these bleak prospects along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever do not provide much hope some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood as our saviors we will soon discover who is right and who is wrong this definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that generation x is comprised of one core group of american citizens it over generalizes the similarities it expresses and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years when in fact these similarities speak primarily to only white issues and concerns for instance they say we depend a lot on our parents but in ghetto america we could only depend on one our mothers they also say we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations and we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever in ghetto america no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now and is all we have time for i have known for many years that the differences that separate generation xer s black and white occupants would eventually be identified i never knew i would be the one doing it extracting the black from generation x and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency without doing so the social ills that plague ghetto america would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective american identity there are many hidden truths that exist in black america today white america charges that we spend our time collecting welfare refusing to vote reading elementary styled books watching music videos day dreaming of becoming rappers basketball players selling drugs and making babies much of this is supported in marlon riggs s documentary entitled ethnic notions when african americans are mentioned whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book a reality that i confirmed while watching roger me another documentary written and directed by michael moore sadly many of us have begun to validate this skewed image while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for b e t black entertainment television many of us fail to realize that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex posed truth may reveal should be taken as an opportunity to improve empower enlighten and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior regarding black women i have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities i began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole that black men owed them something and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives be it emotional physical or economical normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended in most cases it has not been it s funny though looking back i am surprised i never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to or the various schools of thought they possessed many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the african american male some fair and some unfair much of what the public believes and understands about the black female s social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is what originally sparked my attention was an observation i stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction i noticed virtually all of the books i read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent african american perspective these stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all african americans thrive on a middle to upper class professional level they relay stories of relationship problems with huxtable like bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love as i read these stories i couldn t help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or working class african americans although there are those in the black community that can identify with the huxtable like dynamic unfortunately they are few and far between the majority of stories i have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued black america the black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our dirty laundry the fact is truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind i recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal as our discussion intensified i reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed and oftentimes not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself the purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self destructive thinking and self imprisoning behavior that black male and female generation x have been subscribing to while discussing this with my friend she suggested i simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what i m attempting to convey acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood i suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative to grab a dictionary don t feel bad there were several times i had to as well regarding black men an overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool buying sports wear driving expensive cars wearing gold or platinum jewelry and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions i have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of african american culture because i have lived it i have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level it is a world of ignorance selfishness pre occupation and idiocy in my world there are people who applaud a lack of education who brag about having served time in u s penitentiaries the types of guns they carry dope peddling and chasing women they champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit in this world wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they ve got a million it s a world where children dress in over priced sports wear mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye thinking such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one s self worth and the possible corruption this thinking breeds seems to not be an important concern for black mothers it may come as a shock to know that most african americans feel that those who don t have the same if not better material possessions are lesser beings referring to them as being corny lame or broke even our male rapper entertainers promote backward priorities nothing else matters as long as you look good the big tymers a popular rap duo have a song called i m still fly shown in heavy rotation on b e t and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country fly is ghetto vernacular for well dressed also used to describe a female s beauty its signature verse asserts i got gator boots with a pimped out gucci suit can t pay my rent cause all my money s spent but that s o k cause i m still fly worse yet in the song grinding the popular duo eclipse glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video the term grinding is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs the fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on b e t is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil some of the key lyrics to this song are grinding you know what i keep in the lining the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs and patty cake patty cake i m the bakers man i bake them cakes as fast as i can and you can tell cause of how my bread stack up and i disguise it as rap so the feds backup in this verse the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack when created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake hence the term cake or sometimes pie unfortunately for the rap genre this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law the negative references i ve identified have become an integral part of the urban african american existence this mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable this ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has there is an overwhelming part of the african american community that is aware of this crippling mentality there are also many that are unaware and unfortunately more that do not even care those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily whether because of habit or misguided values this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance it should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us we must save ourselves i am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now and are thinking what right do i have to express the opinions i have thus far as well as those i have al luded too i have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content there is far too much negativity thriving within our culture there must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth whether good or bad i am aware that not all of us have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community and i have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life any similarities and generalizations i illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified additionally throughout this book i will refer to african americans in four different ways the first being african americans denoting our status as citizens in the united states secondly as black a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country third as niggas a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with nigger the term nigga has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship hence the term my nigga as well as a blanket reference when speaking to of or about other black males in a non personal manner i felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences i will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place and fourth as ghetto this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the less polished members of our community it is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such my commentary is based on real life situations both good and bad and how one african american man was affected by them to that end i feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals i have encountered despite the negativity they have displayed i only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to in many ways has caused them to become their own worst enemy in the case of the black female s negative and limited perspective toward black men the world and subconsciously themselves i submit that this mentality is perhaps single handedly responsible for the lack of success happiness and quality of life that is at the center of every african american woman s fantasy quest it is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men has been deliberately created by white america for example much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day many past issues have taken on new identities and have re emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men the resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate america without realizing and ackno wledging that this absence is by design there are other core issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation such as color barriers light skin versus dark skin good hair versus bad hair loyalty devotion and economic status believe it or not there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn t sell drugs or was not thugged out a term for being rough or hoodlum like the reasoning behind it being that the thug and drug dealer lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence these issues among others relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society sadly that confused mentality is responsible for much of the neglect the african american ghetto community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren who have locked it away in the basement and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that ghetto america does not exist furthermore the lack of acknowledgement of which i speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the african american community their plight is a well known reality but in many cases much of ghetto america falls under that same umbrella be advised this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into black america rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young african americans including myself have come to perpetuate moreover that backward thinking is the main cause of our inability to strive for a common goal an outcome that must be met and can only be met with godly faith positive strategy cooperation love loyalty self and
